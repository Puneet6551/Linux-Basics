      Block special files  -  Represent devices that are accessed in blocks of data (e.g., hard disks, flash drives).
      Symbolic file        -  (Soft links)These are shortcuts or references to other files or directories.Changing a symbolic link doesn't affect the original file, but deleting it removes the shortcut. (Hard links) its affects other files.
      Character special files  -  Represent devices that are accessed as a stream of characters (e.g., keyboards, terminals).
      Named Pipes (p):     -  Also known as FIFO (First-In, First-Out), they allow communication between different processes. Data written to a named pipe by one process is read by another process in the order it was written.
