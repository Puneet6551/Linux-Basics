File types in linux are below:

      Regular file         -  Regualar file are like images, configuration file, data files and scripts.
      Directory File       -  these are the files that store other files like /home/puneet/user
      Block special files  -  Represent devices that are accessed in blocks of data (e.g., hard disks, flash drives).
      Symbolic file        -  (Soft links)These are shortcuts or references to other files or directories.Changing a symbolic link doesn't affect the original file, but deleting it removes the shortcut. (Hard links) its affects other files.
      Character special files  -  Represent devices that are accessed as a stream of characters (e.g., keyboards, terminals).
      Named Pipes (p):     -  Also known as FIFO (First-In, First-Out), they allow communication between different processes. Data written to a named pipe by one process is read by another process in the order it was written.
      Socket Files (s):    -  Used for inter-process communication, especially over a network.


we can identify file using file command. e:g is below
      file /home/user/file.txt




File system Hierarchy 
      Root Directory (/): This is the main entrance of the library, where everything starts.
      
      Key Sections:
                  
            bin (binaries): Holds essential tools for basic system operations (like turning lights on/off).
            boot (bootloader): Contains files needed to start the computer (like the library's opening procedures).
            dev (devices): Stores files representing hardware components (like the library's computers and printers).
            etc (configuration): Houses system-wide configuration files (like the library's rulebook).
            home (users' homes): Each user has a personal space for their files (like individual desks in the library).
            lib (libraries): Contains shared libraries used by programs (like reference books for the library's visitors).
            media (removable media): Automatically mounts external devices like USB drives (like a special shelf for temporary items).
            mnt (mount points): Temporarily attaches additional storage devices (like extra bookshelves brought in for a specific event).
            opt (optional software): Holds additional software packages not essential to the system (like the library's collection of rare books).
            proc (process information): Provides a virtual file system with information about running processes (like a live feed of who's using the library right now).
            root (root user's home): The superuser's personal directory (like the head librarian's office).
            sbin (system binaries): Contains essential system administration tools (like keys to restricted areas of the library).
            srv (service data): Stores data for services provided by the system (like the library's online catalog).
            sys (system files): Contains information about the kernel and hardware (like technical manuals for the library's infrastructure).
            tmp (temporary files): A space for temporary files (like a scratchpad for visitors).
            usr (user programs): Holds most user-installed applications and libraries (like the main collection of books for visitors).
            var (variable data): Stores data that changes frequently (like the library's logbook of borrowed books).
